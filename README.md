## lxde_ldm_enable.sh - Lightening your OS usage

This script is used for Jetson Nano 4GB users,
when you have a Jetson Nano 2GB it happens automatically.


To use this script you basically will enter the repo folder and type:

sudo sh lxde_ldm_enable.sh

## swap_choose.sh - Choose your Swap Size

This script is used if you want to increase or decrease the usage of your Swap file.

To use the script you will enter the repo folder and type:
